# Overview

Thruster is a Uniswap V2 and V3 fork codebase with modifications to the code to match Blast specific features, and also provide implementation for support of a V3 gauge system to be implemented in the future. The V3 gauge system is out of scope for this audit, but is included in the `ThrusterPool` codebase marked as `gauge`.

A changelog of the modifications can be found in the `ThrusterAudits_Changelog.pdf` file. Additionally, there are two open pull requests, one to show the diffs between the new code and the original V2 core + periphery code, and the other one to show the diffs between the new code and the original V3 core + periphery code.

Additionally, we include a single ThrusterTreasure.sol file that is used to perform a lottery draw like feature. This relies on using the Pyth Entropy product, which relies on off-chain components. The contract itself also relies on an admin to update the Merkle proof for how many tickets a user is entitled to claim, as the number of tickets is also computed off chain. Off-chain components are out of scope for this audit, and problems that are caused by admin error are out of scope for the audit.

## Out of scope

- All contracts under `thruster-cfmm/contracts/libraries/*` except for ThrusterLibrary.sol
- `thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterGasRouter.sol` this is just `ThrusterGas.sol` with a different version for the router
- Router contracts are outside of scope, those had no changes made to them
- Any concentrated liquidity gauge code implementation that will be used by the ThrusterPool
- All contracts under `thruster-clmm/contracts/libraries/*` and `thruster-clmm/contracts/lens/*` and `thruster-clmm/contracts/base/*`, these contracts had no changes aside from name changes
- Any deployment errors are out of scope, e.g. incorrect constructor arguments. For example, we know that we need to use the `ThrusterPoolDeployer.sol` contract address instead of the `ThrusterPoolFactory.sol` contract address when initializing the `SwapRouter.sol`, `QuoterV2.sol` and `NonfungiblePositionManager.sol`.
- MEV attacks are out of scope for this audit.

# Additional Context

- All contracts that use gas should comply with the Blast gas claim logic.
- All contracts that are intended to hold any of the following assets (WETH, USDB, ETH) should comply with the Blast claimable yield logic. The automatic yield is an exception only for ThrusterTreasure.sol, as we will keep a small amount of ETH in the contract to pay for Pyth oracle entropy calls.
- The code follows the same core mechanisms as Uniswap V2 and V3, so constant function market maker and concentrated liquidity market maker.
- Code will be deployed on the Blast L2, which is an Optimism Stack L2
- Privileged role is in charge enabling the fee on the protocol.
- Deployment of pools for both CFMM and CLMM is permissionless
- Claiming of Blast yield and gas is a permissioned role always
- Treasure lottery is structured as users have the option to enter all their existing tickets for the current round or accumulate tickets. There is no option to partially enter tickets or choose specific numbers. It will also be possible for there to be no winners of the lottery, as it is possible to submit ghost tickets via the Merkle by the team.

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)

- ThrusterPool contract for price manipulation
- NonfungiblePositionManager for improper access to liquidity positions
- ThrusterPair contract for price manipulation on trades

## Main invariants

- For ThrusterPair.sol the x * y = k invariant

# Thruster Protocol

All repos are compatible with both Forge Foundry and Eth-Brownie compilation. However, `thruster-cfmm` is not compatible with `forge test` due to Solidity compiler version being too low.

# Compile repositories

```bash
cd thruster-cfmm && forge build
cd ..
cd thruster-clmm && forge build
cd ..
cd thruster-treasure && npm i && forge build
```

or

```bash
cd thruster-cfmm && brownie compile
cd ..
cd thruster-clmm && brownie compile
cd ..
cd thruster-treasure && npm i && brownie compile
```

Two pull requests are opened titled `Diff to show the changes with the V2 contracts` and `Diff to show the changes with the V3 contracts`. These two PRs show the differences
between the Uniswap V2 Core + Periphery code, as well as the Uniswap V3 Core + Periphery code in accordance to the titles.

See the [ThrusterAudits_Changelog.pdf](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/main/thruster-protocol/ThrusterAudits_Changelog.pdf) file for a written report on changes made to the forked codebase.

The main files we want to get audited are:

From Thruster CLMM (Uniswap V3 Fork):

- ThrusterPool.sol
- ThrusterPoolFactory.sol
- ThrusterPoolDeployer.sol
- NonfungiblePositionManger.sol

From Thruster CFMM (Uniswap V2 Fork):

- ThrusterPair.sol
- ThrusterFactory.sol

From Thruster Treasure:

- ThrusterTreasure.sol

Blast specific:

- ThrusterGas.sol
- ThrusterYield.sol

# Tests

It is hard to run tests, as there is Blast specific code. The way we have been testing is by running scripts on the Blast Sepolia Testnet directly.

## Miscellaneous

Employees of Thruster and employees' family members are ineligible to participate in this audit.
